<!-- THE INDEPENDENCE IMPERATIVE -->
<section id="vision" class="vision">
    <h2>Why Complete Independence Matters Now</h2>
    
    <div class="crisis-context">
        <p>South Africa faces unprecedented infrastructure failures. Rolling blackouts plague daily life. Water shortages threaten communities. Municipal services decline while costs soar. Middle-class families spend ZAR 2,000 to 8,000 monthly on backup systems while remaining vulnerable to utility failures, inflation, and economic uncertainty.</p>
        
        <p>Simultaneously, South Africa needs 275,000 green energy workers by 2030, but training institutions lack operational systems for hands-on education. Traditional crafts and cultural practices struggle for economic viability. Communities lack local employment opportunities.</p>
        
        <p>Current eco-villages serve only the wealthy. Urban developments offer cramped compromises with continued utility dependence and limited economic diversity.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>NAU's Revolutionary Response</h3>
        <p>Create a spacious, affordable community achieving complete independence from failing systems while generating revenue through training needed professionals and sustaining diverse local enterprises that preserve cultural heritage and create economic resilience.</p>
